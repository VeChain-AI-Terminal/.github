**Stop visiting websites. Start talking to VeChain.**

Remember when we used to open apps for everything? Now we just talk to AI. We're bringing this same revolution to blockchain - making VeChain operations as simple as conversation.

**THE INTERFACE FOR THE POST-WEBSITE ERA.**

## About

**64+ operations. 25+ bridge destinations. 1 conversation.**

VeChain's ecosystem is exploding with innovation - but users are drowning in interfaces. We solved it by making blockchain operations as simple as sending a text message. This isn't just another blockchain tool - it's the interface for the post-website era.

**We've built what everyone else is promising:**
- 64+ live blockchain operations (not promises)
- Bridge to 25+ chains through conversation
- Real-time AI streaming with live blockchain data  
- Plugin ecosystem like ChatGPT for blockchain

## Why This Changes Everything

- **Post-Website Era**: Stop navigating complex DeFi interfaces - just say what you want
- **Live Operations**: 64+ working blockchain tools, not promises for the future  
- **Universal Access**: Works with Claude Desktop, Cursor, VS Code, and web browsers
- **Plugin Ecosystem**: Any VeChain project can integrate their tools into our AI platform
- **Desktop + Local AI**: Coming Q1 2025 - no OpenAI required, complete privacy control
